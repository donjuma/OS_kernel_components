I ran and tested both the Least Frequently Used and Least Recently Used algorithms and below are my findings.

In both algorithms I noticed that the default settings (i.e. 8MB memory and Simulate(1000);) were such that
the algorithms never needed to page anything out. As such, I altered the options for testing purposes.

First I lowered the memory so low that I forced many pageFaults, I slowly increased that amount until I was
back at the default amount. I also discovered a bug that resulted in the default amount never pageFaulting
as I originally thought this was because the page table was too large.

In any case, throughtout all of my testing, I noticed a reoccuring pattern. In every instance of my testing,
the Least Recently Used algorithm was always better (read: had lower pageFaults) than the Least Frequently
Used algorithm. This makes sense as most of the Access calls had spacially local memory and were in sequence
of each other. Meaning that there were bursts of calls to the same page and as such this resulted in better
performance.

Running the tests three times in a similar enviornment yeilded the following results:
    - Least Frequently Used:
        - Iteration 1:      778 PageFaults
        - Iteration 2:      807 PageFaults
        - Iteration 3:      808 PageFaults
        - Average:          797 PageFaults

    - Least Recently Used:
        - Iteration 1:      664 PageFaults
        - Iteration 2:      684 PageFaults
        - Iteration 3:      634 PageFaults
        - Average:          660 PageFaults

On average, the Least Recently Used algorithm was about 120% more efficient than the Least Frequently Used
algorithm.
